Hi!

This is to help solve a logic problem!
It is written in Python, and there might be a better way for writing the code.
I don't do this often, so I rarely need to simplify code. Especially since they are short in nature.

What is the logic problem you ask?

On the top floor of a castle lives a princess. The floor has 17 bedrooms arranged in a row. Each
bedroom has doors connecting to the adjoining bedrooms as well as to the outside corridor. The
princess sleeps in a different bedroom each night by opening the door to an adjoining bedroom
and spending the night and the next day in that room. 

One day a prince arrives at the castle and is desirous of marrying the princess. The guardian
angel at the castle tells him of the princess sleeping patterns and informs him that each morning
he may knock on one of the outside doors. If the princess happens to be behind that door, she will
open it and consent to marry him. The prince also has a return ticket to his kingdom in 30 days;
so he can make at most 30 attempts. Can the prince win the hand of the princess and if so,
what is his strategy?
